# CRC
16bitCRC experiments:


This implementation is inspired from Hacker's delight.

Todo:


1> Unit testing of the generated CRC.
 
 
2> Reverse engineer the polynomial from 16 bit CRC and provided Data frame.


3> Generic crc program generator. (Input : CRC polynomial; output: CRCgenerator C++ function)
